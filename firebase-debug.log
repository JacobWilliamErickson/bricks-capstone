See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Events\n\nThis extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a product has been added via the `product.created` event, or whenever a payment has succeeded through the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n- If you enable events [Eventarc fees apply](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing))\n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/next/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Prices\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates

This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project4-c148f/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /customers/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /products/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `https://us-west3-project4-c148f.cloudfunctions.net/ext-firestore-stripe-payments-handleWebhookEvents`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project4-c148f/extensions/instances/firestore-stripe-payments?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('products')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `customers/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `customers/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('customers')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('us-west3')\n  .httpsCallable('ext-firestore-stripe-payments-createPortalLink');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","extensionRef":"stripe/firestore-stripe-payments","extensionVersion":"0.3.1"},"lastOperationName":"projects/project4-c148f/operations/73203cdb-238f-489a-904e-87fef06cfff3","serviceAccountEmail":"ext-firestore-stripe-payments@project4-c148f.iam.gserviceaccount.com","lastOperationType":"CONFIGURE","etag":"63876738b50a7078598518b5e9e8ee3055e3faf20a76d9e3d6c497166ae6aa2e"}]}

We do not recommend installing Alpha extensions in production apps.**\n\nUse this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n#### Pricing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Firebase Authentication\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nWhen you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have a Stripe account. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of Stripe and the [Stripe Billing product](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing).\n","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n      allow write: if false;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n        allow write: if false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. For Stripe to be able to reach the webhook handler function, make the extension's `handleWebhookEvents` function public by following [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/managing-access-iam#allowing_unauthenticated_function_invocation) in the Google Cloud console. Here's the official name of the function displayed in the console:\n   `${function:handleWebhookEvents.name}`.\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#reconfigure) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please email stripe-extension-feedback@googlegroups.com with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product:\n\n![Stripe Product Dashboard](http://gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200624_mobilesdk/stripe-advanced-options.png)\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/thorsten-stripe/firestore-stripe-subscriptions-extension-demo);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: formData.get('price'),\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', '==', 'active')\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active Subscription to exist\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0].data();\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\nIn order for your client application to be able to reach the function follow [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/managing-access-iam#allowing_unauthenticated_function_invocation) in the Google Cloud console to make it public. Here's the official name of the function displayed in the console: `${function:createPortalLink.name}`.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please send any feedback to stripe-extension-feedback@googlegroups.com!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: **IMPORTANT: This extension is part of the Firebase Alpha program.

If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n      allow write: if false;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n        allow write: if false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: formData.get('price'),\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', '==', 'active')\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active Subscription to exist\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0].data();\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Subscription Payments with Stripe"},"state":"PUBLISHED","createTime":"2021-11-09T02:03:23.553020Z","releaseNotes":"[feat] Set [promotion codes](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) programmatically. **_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session.

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?

Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Collecting one-time payments without a subscription\n\nYou can also create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nThis extension is meant for the web platform. If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources.

(#157)\n\n[feat] Add support for one-time payment mode. (#39; #133; #151; #164)\n\nYou can now create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n[feat] Add support for shipping address collection. (#26)\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n[Fix] Merge product and price data instead of overwriting. This allows you to add additional data to your product and price docs in Cloud Firestore. Note: this means when you remove metadata keys from your products in Stripe, they won't be removed in Cloud Firestore.

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nThis extension is meant for the web platform. If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Collecting one-time payments without a subscription\n\nYou can also create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Collecting one-time payments without a subscription\n\nYou can also create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nThis extension is meant for the web platform. If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources.

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nThis extension is meant for the web platform. If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it. \n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Collecting one-time payments without a subscription\n\nYou can also create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n      allow write: if false;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n        allow write: if false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: formData.get('price'),\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', '==', 'active')\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active Subscription to exist\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0].data();\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n      allow write: if false;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n        allow write: if false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n      metadata: {\n        item: 'item001',\n      },\n    });\n```\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n      allow write: if false;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n        allow write: if false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. The extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to YES, the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to NO (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Subscription Payments with Stripe"},"state":"PUBLISHED","createTime":"2021-11-09T02:03:23.553020Z","releaseNotes":"[change] - Additional configuration and **change of default behaviour**: you can now disable the automatic sync of new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore, and the default behaviour has been changed to \"on the fly\" creation of customer objects.

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nThis extension is meant for the web platform. If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 20 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

If you're developing native mobile applications and want to sell digital products or services **within** your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Billing ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" resource.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Subscription Payments with Stripe"},"state":"PUBLISHED","createTime":"2021-11-09T02:03:23.553020Z","releaseNotes":"[feat] - Sync tax rates from your Stripe account to Cloud Firestore.

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n      \n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add subscription payments and access control to your websites fully client-side with the [Firebase JavaScript SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup). You can experience a demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\nTo redirect to Stripe Checkout from your web client, you will need to load Stripe.js. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#redirect-checkout) for more information.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Importing Stripe.js as ES module\n\nIf you're using a build toolchain for your client application (e.g. Angular, React, TypeScript, etc.), it is recommended to import and load Stripe.js via the [`stripe-js` module](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js#stripejs-es-module):\n\n```js\nimport {loadStripe} from '@stripe/stripe-js';\n// [...]\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot(async (snap) => {\n  const { error, sessionId } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and \n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (sessionId) {\n    // We have a session, let's redirect to Checkout\n    // Init Stripe\n    const stripe = await loadStripe('pk_test_1234');\n    stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_session` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates to the subscription\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: One-time prices are only supported in combination with recurring prices! If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price). \n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({ returnUrl: window.location.origin });\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nWhen a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user. \n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Run Subscription Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to create subscriptions for your users with the [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments platform and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation.

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details?

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"customers\")\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('customers')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients.

For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Payments with

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Events\n\nThis extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a product has been added via the `product.created` event, or whenever a payment has succeeded through the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n- If you enable events [Eventarc fees apply](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing))\n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details?

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Events\n\nThis extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a product has been added via the `product.created` event, or whenever a payment has succeeded through the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n- If you enable events [Eventarc fees apply](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing))\n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details?

If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates

Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Prices\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Payments with Stripe","events":[{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.created","description":"Occurs whenever a product is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a product is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a product is deleted."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.created","description":"Occurs whenever a price is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a price is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a price is deleted."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.completed","description":"Occurs when a Checkout Session has been successfully completed."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded","description":"Occurs when a payment intent using a delayed payment method finally succeeds."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.async_payment_failed","description":"Occurs when a payment intent using a delayed payment method fails."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.created","description":"Occurs whenever a customer is signed up for a new plan."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a subscription changes (e.g., switching from one plan to another, or changing the status from trial to active)."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a customer's subscription ends."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.tax_rate.created","description":"Occurs whenever a new tax rate is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.tax_rate.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a tax rate is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.paid","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt succeeds or an invoice is marked as paid out-of-band."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_succeeded","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt succeeds."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_failed","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt fails, due either to a declined payment or to the lack of a stored payment method."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.upcoming","description":"Occurs X number of days before a subscription is scheduled to create an invoice that is automatically charged—where X is determined by your subscriptions settings."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.marked_uncollectible","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice is marked uncollectible."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_action_required","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt requires further user action to complete."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.processing","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has started processing."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.succeeded","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has successfully completed payment."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.canceled","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent is canceled."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.payment_failed","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has failed the attempt to create a payment method or a payment."}]},"state":"PUBLISHED","hash":"bb7ad88bf711c9173aede78b14bb28dc293bef7cb903c18b1fce8f4ec2322be5","createTime":"2022-08-23T15:04:51.713254Z","releaseNotes":"[feat] Allow configurable minimum instances for `createCheckoutSession` function.

This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Prices\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources.

See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. \n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Events\n\nThis extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a product has been added via the `product.created` event, or whenever a payment has succeeded through the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Cloud Secret Manager\n- Firebase Authentication\n- If you enable events [Eventarc fees apply](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/pricing).\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing))\n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.","postinstallContent":"### Client SDK\n\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/next/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nUse a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with\nthe Firebase Web SDK.\n\n### Configuring the extension\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you have the following Firebase services set up:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\n#### Set your Cloud Firestore security rules\n\nIt is crucial to limit data access to authenticated users only and for users to only be able to see their own information. For product and pricing information it is important to disable write access for client applications. Use the rules below to restrict access as recommended in your project's [Cloud Firestore rules](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/rules):\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    match /${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid} {\n      allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n\n      match /checkout_sessions/{id} {\n        allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /subscriptions/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n      match /payments/{id} {\n        allow read: if request.auth.uid == uid;\n      }\n    }\n\n    match /${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}/{id} {\n      allow read: if true;\n\n      match /prices/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n\n      match /tax_rates/{id} {\n        allow read: if true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure Stripe webhooks\n\nYou need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.\n\nHere's how to set up the webhook and configure your extension to use it:\n\n1. Configure your webhook:\n\n   1. Go to the [Stripe dashboard.](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n   1. Use the URL of your extension's function as the endpoint URL. Here's your function's URL: `${function:handleWebhookEvents.url}`\n\n   1. Select the following events:\n\n   - `product.created`\n   - `product.updated`\n   - `product.deleted`\n   - `price.created`\n   - `price.updated`\n   - `price.deleted`\n   - `checkout.session.completed`\n   - `customer.subscription.created`\n   - `customer.subscription.updated`\n   - `customer.subscription.deleted`\n   - `payment_intent.processing`\n   - `payment_intent.succeeded`\n   - `payment_intent.canceled`\n   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n   - `tax_rate.created` (optional)\n   - `tax_rate.updated` (optional)\n   - `invoice.paid` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_failed` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.upcoming` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.marked_uncollectible` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n   - `invoice.payment_action_required` (optional, will sync invoices to Cloud Firestore)\n\n1. Using the Firebase console or Firebase CLI, [reconfigure](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/extensions/instances/${param:EXT_INSTANCE_ID}?tab=config) your extension with your webhook’s signing secret (such as, `whsec_12345678`). Enter the value in the parameter called `Stripe webhook secret`.\n\n#### Create product and pricing information (only required when building on the web platform)\n\nFor Stripe to automatically bill your users for recurring payments, you need to create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products). When you create or update your product and price information in the Stripe Dashboard these details are automatically synced with your Cloud Firestore, as long as the webhook is configured correctly as described above.\n\nThe extension currently supports pricing plans that bill a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g. different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported. If you'd like to see support for these, please open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose) with details about your business model and pricing plans.\n\nFor example, this extension works well for business models with different access level tiers, e.g.:\n\n- Product 1: Basic membership\n  - Price 1: 10 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 100 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 8 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 80 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n- Product 2: Premium membership\n  - Price 1: 20 USD per month\n  - Price 2: 200 USD per year\n  - Price 3: 16 GBP per month\n  - Price 4: 160 GBP per year\n  - [...]: additional currency and interval combinations\n\n#### Assign custom claim roles to products (only used for subscriptions)\n\nIf you want users to get assigned a [custom claim role](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims) to give them access to certain data when subscribed to a specific product, you can set a `firebaseRole` metadata value on the Stripe product ([see screenshot](https://www.gstatic.com/mobilesdk/200710_mobilesdk/ext_stripe_subscription_post_install.png)).\n\nThe value you set for `firebaseRole` (e.g. \"premium\" in the screenshot above) will be set as a custom claim `stripeRole` on the user. This allows you to [set specific security access rules](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/03/firebase-security-rules-admin-sdk-tips.html) based on the user's roles, or [limit access to certain pages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/custom-claims#access_custom_claims_on_the_client). For example if you have one `basic` role and one `premium` role you could add the following to your Cloud Firestore rules:\n\n```\nrules_version = '2';\nservice cloud.firestore {\n  match /databases/{database}/documents {\n    function hasBasicSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"basic\";\n    }\n\n    function hasPremiumSubs() {\n      return request.auth.token.stripeRole == \"premium\";\n    }\n\n    match /content-basic/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasBasicSubs() || hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n    match /content-premium/{doc} {\n      allow read: if hasPremiumSubs();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively you can validate their role client-side with the JavaScript SDK. When doing so you need to make sure to force-refresh the user token:\n\n```js\nasync function getCustomClaimRole() {\n  await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdToken(true);\n  const decodedToken = await firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult();\n  return decodedToken.claims.stripeRole;\n}\n```\n\n#### Configure the Stripe customer portal (only used for subscriptions)\n\n1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal).\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update their payment methods\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to update subscriptions\".\n1. Toggle on \"Allow customers to cancel subscriptions\".\n1. Add the products and prices that you want to allow customer to switch between.\n1. Set up the required business information and links.\n\n### Using the extension\n\nOnce you've configured the extension you can add payments and access control to your websites and mobile apps fully client-side with the corresponding Firebase SDKs. You can experience a subscriptions demo application at [https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app](https://stripe-subs-ext.web.app/) and find the demo source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments);\n\n#### Sign-up users with Firebase Authentication\n\nThe quickest way to sign-up new users is by using the [FirebaseUI library](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui). Follow the steps outlined in the official docs. When configuring the extension you can choose to 'Sync' new users to Stripe. If set to 'Sync', the extension listens to new users signing up and then automatically creates a Stripe customer object and a customer record in your Cloud Firestore. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n#### List available products and prices\n\nProducts and pricing information are normal collections and docs in your Cloud Firestore and can be queried as such:\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:PRODUCTS_COLLECTION}')\n  .where('active', '==', true)\n  .get()\n  .then(function (querySnapshot) {\n    querySnapshot.forEach(async function (doc) {\n      console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      const priceSnap = await doc.ref.collection('prices').get();\n      priceSnap.docs.forEach((doc) => {\n        console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n      });\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### One-time payments on the web\n\nYou can create Checkout Sessions for one-time payments when referencing a one-time price ID. One-time payments will be synced to Cloud Firestore into a payments collection for the relevant customer doc if you update your webhook handler in the Stripe dashboard to include the following events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `payment_intent.canceled`, `payment_intent.processing`.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session ID for a one-time payment, pass `mode: 'payment` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    mode: \"payment\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\", // One-time price created in Stripe\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n### Mobile payments (with the mobile payment sheet on iOS and Android)\n\n#### One-time payments\n\nTo create a one time payment in your mobile application, create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'payment'\n- amount: [{payment amount}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- currency: [{currency code}](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency)\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `paymentIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n#### Set up a payment method for future usage\n\nYou can collect a payment method from your customer to charge it at a later point in time. To do so create a new doc in your `${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}/{uid}/checkout_sessions` collection with the following parameters:\n\n- client: 'mobile'\n- mode: 'setup'\n\nThen listen for the extension to append `setupIntentClientSecret`, `ephemeralKeySecret`, and `customer` to the doc and use these to [integrate the mobile payment sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet#integrate-payment-sheet).\n\n### Subscription payments (web only)\n\n#### Start a subscription with Stripe Checkout\n\nTo subscribe the user to a specific pricing plan, create a new doc in the `checkout_sessions` collection for the user. The extension will update the doc with a Stripe Checkout session ID which you then use to redirect the user to the checkout page.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n// Wait for the CheckoutSession to get attached by the extension\ndocRef.onSnapshot((snap) => {\n  const { error, url } = snap.data();\n  if (error) {\n    // Show an error to your customer and\n    // inspect your Cloud Function logs in the Firebase console.\n    alert(`An error occured: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n  if (url) {\n    // We have a Stripe Checkout URL, let's redirect.\n    window.location.assign(url);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### Handling trials\n\nBy default, the trial period days that you've specified on the pricing plan will be applied to the checkout session. Should you wish to not offer the trial for a certain user (e.g. they've previously had a subscription with a trial that they canceled and are now signing up again), you can specify `trial_from_plan: false` when creating the checkout session doc:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection(\"${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}\")\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    trial_from_plan: false,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying discount, coupon, promotion codes\n\nYou can create customer-facing promotion codes in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create). Refer to the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) for a detailed guide on how to set these up.\n\nIn order for the promotion code redemption box to show up on the checkout page, set `allow_promotion_codes: true` when creating the `checkout_sessions` document:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    allow_promotion_codes: true,\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying promotion codes programmatically\n\nYou can set a [promotion code](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/discounts/codes) to be applied to the checkout session without the customer needing to input it.\n\n**_NOTE_**: anyone with access to a promotion code ID would be able to apply it to their checkout session. Therefore make sure to limit your promotion codes and archive any codes you don't want to offer anymore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    promotion_code: \"promo_1HCrfVHYgolSBA35b1q98MNk\",\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Automatic tax calculation with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n\nStripe Tax lets you calculate and collect sales tax, VAT, and GST. Know where to register, automatically collect the right amount of tax, and access the reports you need to file returns.\n\n1. Request access: https://stripe.com/tax#request-access\n2. Set up Stripe Tax in the Dashboard: https://stripe.com/docs/tax/set-up\n3. Enable automatic tax calculation when creating your `checkout_sessions` docs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    automatic_tax: true, // Automatically calculate tax based on the customer's address\n    tax_id_collection: true, // Collect the customer's tax ID (important for B2B transactions)\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying tax rates dynamically\n\nStripe Checkout supports applying the correct tax rate for customers in  US, GB, AU, and all countries in the EU. With [dynamic tax rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout), you create tax rates for different regions (e.g., a 20% VAT tax rate for customers in the UK and a 7.25% sales tax rate for customers in California, US) and Stripe attempts to match your customer’s location to one of those tax rates.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    line_items: [\n      {\n        price: \"price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5\",\n        quantity: 1,\n        dynamic_tax_rates: [\"txr_1IJJtvHYgolSBA35ITTBOaew\", \"txr_1Hlsk0HYgolSBA35rlraUVWO\", \"txr_1HCshzHYgolSBA35WkPjzOOi\"],\n      },\n    ],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Applying static tax rates\n\nYou can collect and report taxes with [Tax Rates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates). To apply tax rates to the subscription, you first need to create your tax rates in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates). When creating a new `checkout_sessions` document, specify the optional `tax_rates` list with [up to five](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/taxes/tax-rates#using-multiple-tax-rates) tax rate IDs:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Collecting a shipping address during checkout\n\nTo collect a shipping address from your customer during checkout, you need to create a `shipping_countries` doc in your `products` collection. This doc needs to have a field called `allowed_countries` which needs to be an array. In this array, add the country codes for the countries that you ship to. You can find a list of supported countries [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n\nSecondly, you need to add `collect_shipping_address: true` to the Checkout Session doc creation:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection(\"checkout_sessions\")\n  .add({\n    collect_shipping_address: true,\n    price: \"price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl\",\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n  });\n```\n\n#### Setting metadata on the subscription\n\nYou can optionally set a metadata object with key-value pairs when creating the checkout session. This can be useful for storing additional information about the customer's subscription. This metadata will be synced to both the Stripe subscription object (making it searchable in the Stripe Dashboard) and the subscription document in the Cloud Firestore.\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n  .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser)\n  .collection('checkout_sessions')\n  .add({\n    price: 'price_1GqIC8HYgolSBA35zoTTN2Zl',\n    success_url: window.location.origin,\n    cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    metadata: {\n      item: 'item001',\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Adding multiple prices, including one-time setup fees\n\nIn addition to recurring prices, you can add one-time prices. These will only be on the initial invoice. This is useful for adding setup fees or other one-time fees associated with a subscription. To do so you will need to pass a `line_items` array instead:\n\n```js\nconst docRef = await db\n    .collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n    .doc(currentUser)\n    .collection('checkout_sessions')\n    .add({\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HCUD4HYgolSBA35icTHEXd5', // RECURRING_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n        {\n          price: 'price_1HEtgDHYgolSBA35LMkO3ExX', // ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID\n          quantity: 1,\n          tax_rates: ['txr_1HCjzTHYgolSBA35m0e1tJN5'],\n        },\n      ],\n      success_url: window.location.origin,\n      cancel_url: window.location.origin,\n    });\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: If you specify more than one recurring price in the `line_items` array, the subscription object in Cloud Firestore will list all recurring prices in the `prices` array. The `price` attribute on the subscription in Cloud Firestore will be equal to the first item in the `prices` array: `price === prices[0]`.\n\nNote that the Stripe customer portal currently does not support changing subscriptions with multiple recurring prices. In this case the portal will only offer the option to cancel the subscription.\n\n#### Start a subscription via the Stripe Dashboard or API\n\nSince version `0.1.7` the extension also syncs subscriptions that were not created via Stripe Checkout, e.g. via the [Stripe Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/create-update-and-schedule-subscriptions) or [via Elements and the API](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/fixed-price).\n\nIn order for this to work, Firebase Authentication users need to be synced with Stripe customer objects and the customers collection in Cloud Firestore (new configuration added in version `0.1.7`).\n\n#### Get the customer's subscription\n\nSubscription details are synced to the `subscriptions` sub-collection in the user's corresponding customer doc.\n\n```js\ndb.collection('${param:CUSTOMERS_COLLECTION}')\n  .doc(currentUser.uid)\n  .collection('subscriptions')\n  .where('status', 'in', ['trialing', 'active'])\n  .onSnapshot(async (snapshot) => {\n    // In this implementation we only expect one active or trialing subscription to exist.\n    const doc = snapshot.docs[0];\n    console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());\n  });\n```\n\n#### Redirect to the customer portal\n\nOnce a customer is subscribed you should show them a button to access the customer portal to view their invoices and manage their payment & subscription details. When the user clicks that button, call the `createPortalLink` function to get a portal link for them, then redirect them.\n\n```js\nconst functionRef = firebase\n  .app()\n  .functions('${param:LOCATION}')\n  .httpsCallable('${function:createPortalLink.name}');\nconst { data } = await functionRef({\n  returnUrl: window.location.origin,\n  locale: \"auto\", // Optional, defaults to \"auto\"\n  configuration: \"bpc_1JSEAKHYgolSBA358VNoc2Hs\", // Optional ID of a portal configuration: https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration\n});\nwindow.location.assign(data.url);\n```\n\n#### Delete User Data\n\nYou have the option to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe by setting the deletion option in the configuration to \"Auto delete\". In that case, when a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication, the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\nThe extension will not delete any data from Cloud Firestore. Should you wish to delete the customer data from Cloud Firestore, you can use the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\nAccess the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage all aspects of your Stripe account.\n\nEnjoy and please submit any feedback and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/new/choose)!\n","readmeContent":"# Web & Mobile Payments with Stripe\n\n**Author**: Stripe (**[https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Controls access to paid content by syncing your subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.\n\nThe extension supports multiple use cases:\n\n- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.\n- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.\n- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).\n\n#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout\n\nUsers can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.\n\nThis extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.\n\nThe design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:\n\n![Stripe Checkout Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-checkout.png)\n![Stripe Customer Portal](https://storage.googleapis.com/stripe-subscriptions-firebase-screenshots/firebase-stripe-subs-customer-portal.png)\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases.\nYou can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)\nJavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides\nTypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client\napplications would want to implement using the extension.\n\nIf you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. \n\nFor all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, set up the following Firebase services in your Firebase project:\n\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store customer & subscription details.\n  - Follow the steps in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create) to create a Cloud Firestore database.\n- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to enable different sign-up options for your users.\n  - Enable the sign-in methods in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) that you want to offer your users.\n\nThen, in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com):\n\n- Create a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources, and read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Prices\" resources.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses the following Firebase services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n- Firebase Authentication\n\nThis extension also uses the following third-party services:\n\n- Stripe Payments ([pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing)) \n- Stripe Billing (when using subscriptions. [pricing information](https://stripe.com/pricing#billing-pricing))\n\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your use of these services.\n\n#### Note from Firebase\n\nTo install this extension, your Firebase project must be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. You will only be charged for the resources you use. Most Firebase services offer a free tier for low-volume use. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nStarting August 17 2020, you will be billed a small amount (typically less than $0.10) when you install or reconfigure this extension. See the [Cloud Functions for Firebase billing FAQ](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-15) for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions deployment location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* Products and pricing plans collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe pricing plans?\n\n* Customer details and subscriptions collection: What is the path to the Cloud Firestore collection where the extension should store Stripe customer details? This can be the location of an existing user collection, the extension will not overwrite your existing data but rather merge the Stripe data into your existing `uid` docs.\n\n* Sync new users to Stripe customers and Cloud Firestore: Do you want to automatically sync new users to customer objects in Stripe? If set to 'Sync', the extension will create a new customer object in Stripe and add a new doc to the customer collection in Firestore when a new user signs up via Firebase Authentication. If set to 'Do not sync' (default), the extension will create the customer object \"on the fly\" with the first checkout session creation.\n\n* Automatically delete Stripe customer objects: Do you want to automatically delete customer objects in Stripe?  When a user is deleted in Firebase Authentication or in Cloud Firestore and set to 'Auto delete'  the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.\n\n* Stripe API key with restricted access: What is your Stripe API key?  We recommend creating a new [restricted key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#limit-access) with write access only for the \"Customers\", \"Checkout Sessions\" and \"Customer portal\" resources. And read-only access for the \"Subscriptions\" and \"Plans\" resources.\n\n* Stripe webhook secret: This is your signing secret for a Stripe-registered webhook.  This webhook can only be registered after installation. Leave this value untouched during installation, then follow the  postinstall instructions for registering your webhook and configuring this value.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **createCustomer:** Creates a Stripe customer object when a new user signs up.\n\n* **createCheckoutSession:** Creates a Checkout session to collect the customer's payment details.\n\n* **createPortalLink:** Creates links to the customer portal for the user to manage their payment & subscription details.\n\n* **handleWebhookEvents:** Handles Stripe webhook events to keep subscription statuses in sync and update custom claims.\n\n* **onUserDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the user is deleted in Firebase Authentication.\n\n* **onCustomerDataDeleted:** Deletes the Stripe customer object and cancels all their subscriptions when the customer doc in Cloud Firestore is deleted.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* firebaseauth.admin (Reason: Allows the extension to set custom claims for users.)\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows the extension to store customers & subscriptions in Cloud Firestore.)\n","externalServices":[{"name":"Stripe","pricingUri":"https://stripe.com/pricing"}],"displayName":"Run Payments with Stripe","events":[{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.created","description":"Occurs whenever a product is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a product is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.product.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a product is deleted."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.created","description":"Occurs whenever a price is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a price is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.price.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a price is deleted."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.completed","description":"Occurs when a Checkout Session has been successfully completed."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded","description":"Occurs when a payment intent using a delayed payment method finally succeeds."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.checkout.session.async_payment_failed","description":"Occurs when a payment intent using a delayed payment method fails."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.created","description":"Occurs whenever a customer is signed up for a new plan."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a subscription changes (e.g., switching from one plan to another, or changing the status from trial to active)."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.customer.subscription.deleted","description":"Occurs whenever a customer's subscription ends."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.tax_rate.created","description":"Occurs whenever a new tax rate is created."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.tax_rate.updated","description":"Occurs whenever a tax rate is updated."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.paid","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt succeeds or an invoice is marked as paid out-of-band."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_succeeded","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt succeeds."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_failed","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt fails, due either to a declined payment or to the lack of a stored payment method."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.upcoming","description":"Occurs X number of days before a subscription is scheduled to create an invoice that is automatically charged—where X is determined by your subscriptions settings."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.marked_uncollectible","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice is marked uncollectible."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.invoice.payment_action_required","description":"Occurs whenever an invoice payment attempt requires further user action to complete."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.processing","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has started processing."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.succeeded","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has successfully completed payment."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.canceled","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent is canceled."},{"type":"com.stripe.v1.payment_intent.payment_failed","description":"Occurs when a PaymentIntent has failed the attempt to create a payment method or a payment."}]},"state":"PUBLISHED","hash":"52cdc018295f358d97a302dd2802e3189f0679e44e6740199155104364611267","createTime":"2022-08-24T14:14:37.173255Z","sourceDownloadUri":"https://storage.googleapis.com/firebase-mod-sources-prod/52cdc018295f358d97a302dd2802e3189f0679e44e6740199155104364611267","releaseNotes":"[chore] Added `package-lock.json` to version control to prevent installation issues.
